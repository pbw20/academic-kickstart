# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Eggs and derived products form an integral part of the food chain. Hence, research  into egg structure, function, and production is prevalent. The past decade has seen  more than two thousand papers published in relation to avian egg science, these  works supplem enting our understanding of the nature of the avian egg, and its  biological, chemical, and physical properties. Eggshell colour, strength and chemical  composition, poultry nutrition, and genetics and have all been intensively studied  recently, with signifi cant progress being made in a number of these areas. Indeed,  with the prevalence of robust theoretical techniques, it is now commonplace to  combine  experimental  investigations  with  theory,  providing  a  balanced  and  interdisciplinary perspective. There is, h owever, still a gulf of understanding in  terms of the structure and formation of the avian egg. In particular, the manner in  which the shell itself begins to form on the outer albumin, and the fascinating  properties it exhibits."
