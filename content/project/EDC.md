# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Following the successful award of a Cancer Research UK - EPSRC -STFC grant to the 'Quantum Leapers' consortium led by Prof Mel Mather (Nottingham) and Dr Philippe Wilson (DMU), the use of novel diamond sensors in early detection is being explored. A strong collaboration between The Universities of Nottingham, De Montfort, Leicester and Queen Mary London is at the heart of this project which seeks to take advantage of nitrogen vacancies within diamond frameworks to understand the early stages of breast cancer development."
