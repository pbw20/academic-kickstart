+++ abstract = "DFT calculations for methyl cation complexed within a constrained cage of water molecules permit the controlled manipulation of the “axial” donor/acceptor distance and the “equatorial” distance to hydrogen-bond acceptors. The kinetic isotope effect k(CH3)/k(CT3) for methyl transfer within a cage with a short axial distance becomes less inverse for shorter equatorial C⋅⋅⋅O distances: a decrease of 0.5 Å results in a 3 % increase at 298 K. Kinetic isotope effects in AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases may be m∧odulated by CH⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bonding, and factors other than axial compression may contribute, at least partially, to recently reported isotope-effect variations for catechol-O-methyltransferase and its mutant structures." abstract_short = "" authors = ["PB Wilson","IH Williams"] date = "2016-01-28" image = "" image_preview = "" math = true publication = "In Signal Image Technology & Internet Systems (SITIS), IEEE." publication_short = "" selected = false title = "Influence of Equatorial CH⋅⋅⋅O Interactions on Secondary Kinetic Isotope Effects for Methyl Transfer" url_code = "" url_dataset = "" url_pdf = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201511708/epdf" url_project = "project/isotope-effect-calculations-in-the-supramolecular-age/" url_slides = "" url_video = ""
