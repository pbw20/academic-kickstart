abstract = "Analytical chemistry has often been a difficult subject to teach in a classroom or lecture-based context. Numerous strategies for overcoming the inherently practical-based difficulties have been suggested, each with differing pedagogical theories. Here, we present a combined approach to tackling the problem of teaching analytical chemistry, with particular emphasis on inherently practice-based cohorts such as pharmacists. A composite visual, interactive, didactic, and practical approach is presented, in which students are able to fully engage with the teaching/training materials within numerous contexts. From unit evaluations, studentâ€“staff liaison committee feedback, and an analysis of marks issued from virtual learning environment quizzes, the enthusiasm of the students for such an approach is found to correlate with their understanding of the topic. The broad outline of the course is included as an example."
